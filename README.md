# Weather-Dash

## Description

This project is for a weather forecast dashboard. When cities are typed in the search bar, the weather forecast for a 5-day week is displayed.
A search history keeps log of the cities that were searched for previously and when selected it will bring up that cities weather forecast.
I've learned aspects of Server and API programming concepts and how to connect the back-end of a Web-API to the front-end.

To add a screenshot, create an `assets/images` folder in your repository and upload your screenshot to it. Then, using the relative filepath, add it to your README using the following syntax:
