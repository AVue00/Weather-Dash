# Weather-Dash

## Description

This project is for a weather forecast dashboard. When cities are typed in the search bar, the weather forecast for a 5-day week is displayed.
A search history keeps log of the cities that were searched for previously and when selected it will bring up that city's weather forecast. Cities from the history can also be deleted.
Developing this project I've learned aspects of Server and API programming concepts and how to connect the back-end of a Web-API to the front-end.

The red button with a trash can symbol is the button to delete previous searched cities from the log.
